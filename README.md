# GitContentUpdater
A small tool created in Python3 that can help you easily move a file from one Git repository to another Git repository, and remove a specific file from the target Git repository.

NOTE: To refer to a custom source and destination git repository, replace the arguments in the CourseContentUpdater constructor (i.e., source_repo_url, target_repo_url, lessons_file_name). This helper script is primarily for the Data Science Bootcamp course by UofT.
